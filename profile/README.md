# Dynamics Operator Foundry

Welcome to **DOF — Dynamics Operator Foundry**!  


<div style="text-align: justify;">

<ul>
  <li>
    We are a community-driven initiative for robotics enthusiasts, offering tools, libraries, and insights across a broad range of topics — from estimators and simulators to data-driven algorithms and control strategies.
  </li>
  <li>
    In robotics, many components — whether model-based or learned — can be interpreted as <strong>mathematical operators</strong>: abstract systems that transform inputs into outputs. This operator-centric viewpoint is the <em>pièce de résistance</em> of our philosophy and the inspiration behind our name, <strong>Dynamics Operator Foundry</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Beyond code, DOF is also committed to a larger vision: promoting decentralized, accessible STEM education for learners around the world.
