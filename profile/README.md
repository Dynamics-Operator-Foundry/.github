# Dynamics-Operator-Foundry

Welcome to **DOF — Dynamics Operator Foundry**!  

- We are a community-driven initiative for robotics enthusiasts, offering tools, libraries, and insights across a broad range of topics — from estimators and simulators to data-driven algorithms and control strategies.

- In robotics, many components — whether model-based or learned — can be interpreted as **mathematical operators**: abstract systems that transform inputs into outputs. This operator-centric viewpoint is the *pièce de résistance* of our philosophy and the inspiration behind our name, *Dynamics Operator Foundry*.

- Beyond code, DOF is also committed to a larger vision: promoting decentralized, accessible STEM education for learners around the world.

Stay tuned — and don’t hesitate to reach out for discussion or collaboration!
